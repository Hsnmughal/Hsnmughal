Hey there, folks! 👋
I'm a blockchain developer passionate about building decentralized solutions that actually solve real problems. When I'm not wrangling smart contracts, you might find me exploring DeFi protocols or thinking about the next big thing in web3.
🔭 What I'm up to

Building cool DeFi stuff that doesn't completely fall apart under audit 😅
Exploring bonding curve mechanics and token economics
Trying to make smart contracts that regular humans can actually afford to use (gas optimization ftw!)

💻 Tech I work with
javascriptconst tech = {
  blockchain: ['Solidity', 'EVM', 'Smart Contracts', 'Bonding Curves'],
  frameworks: ['Hardhat', 'Foundry', 'Remix', 'Truffle'],
  frontend: ['React', 'TypeScript', 'ethers.js'],
  testing: ['Chai', 'Forge', 'Mainnet Forking'],
  protocols: ['Uniswap', 'Bancor', 'Aave', 'Compound']
};
🌱 Current project
Check out my Bancor Bonding Curve Token Launchpad - a fundraising platform where early birds actually get better deals. It's like an ICO but without the rug pull vibes!
💬 Let's connect!
I'm always down to chat about blockchain tech, token economics, or why gas prices make us all sad. Shoot me a message if you want to collaborate or just talk shop!

🎯 Fun fact
I once spent 48 hours debugging a smart contract only to find out I used >= instead of <=. Don't code tired, friends! ☕
