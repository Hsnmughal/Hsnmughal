# Hi there! I'm Hsn 👋

Former protocol builder turned smart contract security researcher ☕→💻🔍  
I build systems, then try to break them as efficiently as possible.

## ✨ About Me
I’m a blockchain engineer who deliberately shifted focus from pure development to **smart contract security and DeFi research**.

After building lending systems, integrations, and full-stack dApps, I moved toward:
- Auditing protocols instead of just shipping them
- Reasoning about **invariants, trust boundaries, and economic exploits**
- Stress-testing assumptions teams forget to write down

I’m interested in *why* contracts fail, not just *how* to deploy them.

## 🛠️ Engineering Background
```
Solidity | EVM | Hardhat | Foundry | Remix
Node.js | Express | MongoDB | React | TypeScript | Next.js
Web3.js | Ethers.js | REST | GraphQL
```

## 🔐 Security Research Focus
```
Smart Contract Auditing & Manual Review
DeFi Protocol Design & Threat Modelling
Lending / Borrowing Systems
Liquidation Logic & Oracle Risk
Precision Loss & Overflow Edge Cases
Access Control & Authorisation Bugs
Gas Griefing & Economic Attacks
```

## 🧪 Security Tooling & Methods
```
Interest Accrual Edge Cases
Invariant Violations in DeFi Protocols
State Desync & Accounting Bugs
Adversarial User Behaviour
Gas & Storage-Level Exploits
```


## 💬 Let's Chat
If you’re:
- Building a DeFi protocol and want a hostile review
- Looking for a security-minded engineer
- Interested in audits, research, or tooling

Feel free to reach out.  
I don’t ship vibes — I ship proofs and counterexamples.
